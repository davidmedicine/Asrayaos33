You are joining Asraya OS, an AI-powered creative operating system that lets visionary users collaborate with seven default AI agents (Oracle, Muse, Navigator, Editor, Seeker, Chrono, Witness).
The product blends chat, quests, a 3-panel dashboard, and a 3-D “inner-verse” world.

Core Stack (2025-05-17)

Frontend – Next.js 15.2.2 (App Router) | React 19 | Tailwind CSS v4 (@theme tokens, OKLCH) | Zustand slices | Framer Motion & GSAP Premium | React-Three-Fiber (for 3-D orbs & worlds).

Backend / Realtime – Supabase (edge functions, Realtime Broadcast + Presence, Auth) | Drizzle ORM | Postgres schema with RLS.

Agent Orchestration – LangGraph + Vercel AI SDK (streaming thinking traces, A2A protocol).

Workers / AI horsepower – Modal.com containers (Python) for long-running, GPU-heavy, or service-role tasks.

Edge compute – Mixed: Supabase Edge Functions and Vercel Edge Functions when lower-latency or public CORS is required.

Design Language – “Asraya Aethelstone Codex” → mystical-meets-minimal, dark + light schemes, theme-per-agent.

Current Milestone (‘First Flame’ Ritual Quest)

Quest engine = 5-day guided ritual (“First Flame”).

Day-definition JSONs live in Supabase Storage bucket asrayaospublicbucket/5-day/ → day-1.json … day-5.json.

Key runtimes

supabase/functions/get-flame-status/ (TS) – idempotently seeds quest rows & tells client which ritual day is next.

modal_app/update_flame_status.py – Modal worker that loads Day-N JSON, validates, updates DB, then broadcasts flame_status:ready.

_shared/5dayquest/flame-data-loader.ts – client-side LRU loader that JSON-imports & Zod-validates day files.

Recent Constant Change

ts
Copy
Edit
// shared constants across all runtimes
const DAYDEF_PREFIX = '5-day/';           // TS (edge/runtime)
DAYDEF_PREFIX : Final[str] = '5-day/'     # Python (Modal worker)
All loaders should build paths as ${DAYDEF_PREFIX}day-${day}.json.

File/Module Highlights

globals.css – tokenized Tailwind, agent themes, container-query utilities.

src/components/sidebar/OracleSphere.tsx – 3-D orb in collapsed sidebar.

src/features/hub/components/... – Unified Chat + Quest 3-panel UI with TanStack Query + Zustand.

supabase/functions/_shared/5dayquest/flame-data-loader.ts – NOTE: uses DAYDEF_PREFIX and an in-memory Map for 7-entry LRU.

Conventions & Tips

Prefer service-role work in Modal to avoid exposing secrets; keep edge functions skinny.

All code must compile under pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck.

Keep animations declarative (GSAP Flip or Framer Motion) and theme-aware.

When adding files to Supabase Storage via CLI/UI avoid double “//” – correct path: asrayaospublicbucket/5-day/day-1.json.

Zod schemas live in supabase/functions/_shared/zod/. Add or update there first, then regenerate TS/ Python types.

Immediate TODOs

Finish constant-sync sweep – ensure every runtime (edge, Modal, client loader) imports DAYDEF_PREFIX.

Verify edge CORS – get-flame-status must be callable from browser with OPTIONS pre-flight.

Write unit tests for flame-data-loader.ts (cache hits, LRU eviction, schema failure).

Bug hunt – UnifiedChatListPanel still hits “Maximum update depth exceeded” (check useEffect deps at line 184).

What I need from you (the AI)

Answer architecture & debugging questions.

Generate clean, type-safe TS / Python patches that respect the stack above.

Propose performance or DX improvements without breaking agent theming.

Keep responses concise, actionable, and cite any external sources you reference.
