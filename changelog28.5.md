# Changelog - May 28, 2025

## First Flame Temporal Workflow Fix

### Issues Fixed
- Fixed undefined error messages in the Edge Functions
- Properly implemented the modal_app/ensure_flame_state endpoint
- Improved error handling in insert-day1 Edge Function
- Enhanced quest validation in the shared db helper functions

### Changes Made

#### 1. `insert-day1/index.ts`
- Added proper try/catch blocks to handle errors correctly
- Fixed error logging to include actual error objects
- Added more detailed debugging information
- Improved error handling with specific error codes
- Added environment variable validation
- Implemented database connection testing before operations
- Used the shared helper for flame_progress record creation
- Added more detailed error return codes
- Key changes:
  - Added early environment variable validation
  - Added database connection test
  - Replaced direct database upsert with shared helper
  - Added explicit try/catch blocks around all database operations
  - Improved error logging with detailed error objects

#### 2. `modal_app/ensure_flame_state/index.ts`
- Created complete implementation with proper error handling
- Fixed import paths:
  - Changed from `../../_shared/cors.js` to `../../_shared/cors.ts`
  - Added imports for required functions:
    - `getOrCreateFirstFlameProgress` from `../../_shared/db/firstFlame.ts`
    - `log` from `../../_shared/logger.ts`
    - `createClient` from `https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2`
- Set proper JWT verification to use service_role
- Added structured error handling:
  - Proper HTTP response codes
  - Consistent error format
  - Detailed error logging
- Implemented proper integration with `getOrCreateFirstFlameProgress` function
- Added debug logging for better troubleshooting

#### 3. `_shared/db/firstFlame.ts`
- Enhanced error handling throughout the module
- Added detailed logging for all operations
- Added quest existence validation before attempting to create progress
- Implemented quest lookup by ID and slug if necessary
- Key changes:
  - Added try/catch blocks around all database operations
  - Added detailed error logging for all functions
  - Enhanced the getOrCreateFirstFlameProgress function to ensure quest exists
  - Added quest lookup by slug when ID is not found
  - Improved safeUpsert function to handle errors

### Root Cause Analysis
The main issues were:
1. Error objects weren't being properly passed to the logger functions
2. The modal_app/ensure_flame_state function had incorrect imports and lacked proper implementation
3. The insert-day1 function didn't have proper try/catch blocks around database operations
4. The shared firstFlame.ts helpers didn't validate quest existence properly
5. Environment variables weren't being validated
6. Database connection issues weren't being properly detected and reported

These issues resulted in "undefined" errors being logged and the workflow failing to complete successfully.

### Testing Instructions
1. Start the Supabase Edge Functions locally: `npm run supa:serve`
2. Make sure environment variables are properly set in your local environment:
   - SUPABASE_URL
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
3. Start the Temporal worker: (appropriate command for your setup)
4. Trigger the workflow with a user ID and quest ID
5. Check the logs for any errors
6. Verify that the workflow completes successfully

### Notes
- The Edge Functions now include much more detailed logging when DEBUG flags are enabled
- Error handling is more robust and includes proper error objects
- Both functions now properly validate input parameters
- Environment variables are properly validated
- Database connection is tested before attempting operations
- Quest existence is validated before creating flame_progress records
